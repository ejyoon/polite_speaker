\begin{abstract}
Language is a remarkably efficient tool for transmitting information.
Yet human speakers make statements that are inefficient, imprecise, or
even contrary to their own beliefs, all in the service of being polite.
What rational machinery underlies polite language use? Here, we show
that polite speech emerges from the competition of three communicative
goals: to convey information, to be kind, and to present oneself in a
good light. We formalize this goal tradeoff using a probabilistic model
of utterance production, which predicts human utterance choices in
socially-sensitive situations with high quantitative accuracy, and we
show that our full model is superior to its variants with subsets of the
three goals. This utility-theoretic approach to speech acts takes a step
towards explaining the richness and subtlety of social language use.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

We don't always say what's on our minds. Although \enquote{close the
window!} could be sufficient, we dawdle, adding \enquote{can you
please\ldots{}?} or \enquote{would you mind\ldots{}?} Rather than tell
an uncomfortable truth, socially-aware speakers exaggerate
(\enquote{Your dress looks great!}) and prevaricate (\enquote{Your poem
was so appropriate to the occasion}). Such language use is puzzling for
classical views of language as information transfer (Buhler, 1934; Frank
\& Goodman, 2012; Jakobson, 1960; Shannon, 1948). On the classical view,
transfer ought to be efficient and accurate: Speakers are expected to
choose succinct utterances to convey their beliefs (Grice, 1975; Searle,
1975), and the information conveyed is ideally truthful to the extent of
a speaker's knowledge. Polite speech violates these basic expectations
about the nature of communication: It is typically inefficient and
underinformative, and sometimes even outright false. Yet even young
speakers spontaneously produce requests in polite forms (Axia \& Baroni,
1985), and adults use politeness strategies pervasively -- even while
arguing (Holtgraves, 1997), and even though polite utterances may risk
high-stakes misunderstandings (Bonnefon, Feeney, \& De Neys, 2011).

If politeness only gets in the way of effective information transfer,
why be polite? Most obvious is the fact that we have social
relationships to maintain, and most linguistic theories assume speaker
behavior is motivated by these concerns, couched as either polite maxims
(Leech, 1983), social norms (Ide, 1989), or aspects of a speaker and/or
listener's identity, known as \emph{face} (Brown \& Levinson, 1987;
Goffman, 1967). Face-based theories predict that when a speaker's
intended meaning contains a threat to the listener's face or self-image
(and potentially the speaker's face), her messages will be less direct,
less efficient, and possibly untruthful. Indeed, when interpreting
utterances in face-threatening situations, listeners readily assume that
speakers intend to be polite (Bonnefon, Feeney, \& Villejoubert, 2009).
How this socially-aware calculation unfolds, however, is not well
understood. Adopting an example from Bonnefon et al. (2009), when should
a speaker decide to say something false (\enquote{Your poem was great!}
said of an actually-mediocre poem) rather than to tell the truth
(\enquote{Your poem was bad}) or to be indirect (\enquote{Some of the
metaphors were tricky to understand.})? How do the speaker's goals enter
into the calculation?

We propose a utility-theoretic solution to the problem of understanding
polite language, in which speakers choose their utterance by attempting
to maximize utilities that represent competing communicative goals.
Under the classic pragmatic view of language production, speakers want
to be informative and convey accurate information as efficiently as
possible (Goodman \& Frank, 2016; Grice, 1975); this desire for
informative and efficient communication we call \emph{informational
utility}. In addition, speakers may want to be kind and make the
listener feel good (i.e., save the listener's face), for example, by
stating positive remarks about the listener. The utility that underlies
this goal is a \emph{prosocial utility}.

If a speaker wants to be informative and kind, then she would ideally
produce utterances that satisfy both goals. The nuances of reality,
however, can make it difficult to satisfy both goals. In particular,
when the true state of the world is of low value to the listener (e.g.,
the listener's poem was terrible), informational and prosocial goals
pull in opposite directions. Informational utility could be maximized by
stating the blunt truth (\enquote{your poem was terrible.}) but that
would very likely hurt the listener's feelings and threaten the
listener's self-image (low prosocial utility); prosocial utility could
be maximized through a white lie (\enquote{your poem was amazing}), but
at the cost of being misleading (low informational utility). In such
situations, it seems impossible to be both truthful and kind. A first
contribution of our work here is to formalize the details of this
tradeoff in order to predict experimental data.

A second contribution of our work is to develop and test a new
theoretical proposal. We propose that speakers may navigate their way
out of the truth-kindness conflict by signalling to the listener that
they care about both of the goals, even while they are genuinely unable
to fulfill them. We formalize this notion of \emph{self-presentational
utility} and show that it leads speakers to prefer indirect speech:
utterances that provide less information relative to alternatives with a
similar meaning.

We look at indirect speech in this paper through negated adjectival
phrases (e.g., \enquote{It \emph{wasn't bad}}). The relationship between
negation and politeness is a topic of long-standing interest to
linguists and psychologists (Bolinger, 1972; Horn, 1989; Stern, 1931;
Stoffel, 1901). Comprehending negation, as a logical operation, can be
psychologically more complex than comprehending an unnegated assertion,
resulting in difficulty in processing of negations (Clark \& Chase,
1972; see Nordmeyer \& Frank, 2014 for an underlying pragmatic
explanation) as well as failure to recognize or recall the asserted
content (Lea \& Mulligan, 2002; MacDonald \& Just, 1989). Our interest
in negation, however, is for its information-theoretic properties:
Negating an assertion that has a specific meaning results in a meaning
that is less precise and lower in informativity (e.g., negating
\enquote{Alex has blue eyes} results in the statement that \enquote{Alex
has eyes that are some color other than blue}). In our paradigm, we use
negation as a way of turning a relatively direct statement (\enquote{It
was terrible}) into an indirect statement (\enquote{It wasn't terrible})
whose interpretation includes some possibilities that are consistent
with or close to the unnegated statement (i.e., the poem was not
terrible, but it was still pretty bad).

Multifactorial, verbal theories -- like previous proposals regarding
politeness -- are very difficult to relate directly to behavioral data.
Therefore, to test our hypotheses about the factors underlying the
production of polite language (what we refer to as its utility
structure), we take a model comparison approach. We do this by
formalizing the trade-off between different combinations of speakers'
utilities in a class of probabilistic models of language use (the
Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework; Frank \& Goodman, 2012; Goodman \&
Frank, 2016), with a particular focus on models with and without the
self-presentational utility. In this framework, speakers are modeled as
agents who choose utterances by reasoning about their potential effects
on a listener, while listeners infer the meaning of an utterance by
reasoning about speakers and what goals could have led them to produce
their utterances. These models build on the idea that human social
cognition can be approximated via reasoning about others as rational
agents who act to maximize their subjective utility (Baker, Saxe, \&
Tenenbaum, 2009), a hypothesis which has found support in a wide variety
of work with both adults and children (e.g., Jara-Ettinger, Gweon,
Schulz, \& Tenenbaum, 2016; Liu, Ullman, Tenenbaum, \& Spelke, 2017).
Indeed, this class of pragmatic language models has been productively
applied to understand a wide variety of complex linguistic behaviors,
including vagueness (Lassiter \& Goodman, 2017), hyperbole (Kao, Wu,
Bergen, \& Goodman, 2014), and irony (Kao \& Goodman, 2015), among
others.

\appendix

\section{Sample Appendix Section}
We derive the result in Eq. \eqref{eq:analytical_linear}. We consider a linear $C_L(\tau_L+\taupav)=K_L(\tau_L+\taupav)$, and
make two further 
simplifications: (i) the subject does not
engage in leisure in the pre-reward state (and so works for the whole
price when it works); and (ii) \emph{a priori}, arbitrarily long leisure durations are possible
($\lambda=0$).
Then the reward rate in Eq. \eqref{eq:rhoCHT} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:analyticalrho}
\rho^{\pi}= \frac{\vrule height 10pt width0pt RI + K_L \{~ \mathbb{E}[ \tau_L | \textrm{post} ] + \taupav  \} }
     {P +
\mathbb{E}[ \tau_L | \textrm{post} ] +\taupav  } 
\end{equation} 
As discussed in the \emph{Results} section, the probability of engaging in instrumental leisure in the post-reward state is $\pi([L,\tau_L]
~| \textrm{post}) = \exp\left[-\{\beta (\rho^\pi-K_L) 
 \} \tau_L\right]$, which is an exponential distribution with
mean 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[\tau_L | \textrm{post}]=\frac{1}{\beta (\rho^\pi-K_L) }
\label{eq:analyticaltauL}
\end{equation}  
Re-arranging terms of this equation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rhoversion2}
\rho^{\pi}=\frac{1}{\beta ~\mathbb{E}[\tau_L | \textrm{post}]} +K_L 
\end{equation} 
Equating Eqs. \eqref{eq:analyticalrho} and \eqref{eq:rhoversion2} and solving for the mean instrumental leisure duration $\mathbb{E}[\tau_L | \textrm{post}]$, we derive
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[\tau_L | \textrm{post}] = \frac{P+\taupav}{\beta ( RI - K_LP)-1} 
\label{eq:solvedtauL}
\end{equation}
which is the second line of Eq.\eqref{eq:analytical_linear}. This is the mean instrumental leisure duration as long as  $RI - K_LP>1$, and  $\mathbb{E}[\tau_L | \textrm{post}] \rightarrow \infty$ otherwise. When the former condition holds, we may
substitute Eq. \eqref{eq:solvedtauL} into Eq. \eqref{eq:analyticalrho} and solve for $\rho^{\pi}$

\section{Making Your Bibliography for an Open Mind Article}
{\it Open Mind} uses the APA author-date  bibliography style,
apacite.bst. For more
information on apacite, for examples in how to make your .bib file and more, see:\\
\href{http://mirror.jmu.edu/pub/CTAN/biblio/bibtex/contrib/apacite/apacite.pdf}
{http://mirror.jmu.edu/pub/CTAN/biblio/bibtex/contrib/apacite/apacite.pdf}

\noindent
(In spite of the mention of apacite cite commands, please use only
Natbib commands for in text citations, as shown above.)

\subsection{BibTeX}
You will need to use BibTeX to form your bibliography; typing in the
references would be
a huge and unpleasant task. Look at the openmindsample.bbl file and you'll see why
typing in the bibitems would be difficult. 

For a good basic introduction to using BibTeX, see
\href{https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM}
{https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM}

When you use BibTeX, the form of the bibliography will be correct. You
don't need to supply a bibliography style, since that is built into
the stjour.cls file.
